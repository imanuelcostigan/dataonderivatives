Description: Post Global Financial Crisis derivatives reforms have lifted the 
  veil off over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. Swap Execution Facilities
  (SEFs) and Swap Data Repositories (SDRs) now publish data on swaps that are 
  traded on or reported to those facilities (respectively). This package provides
  you the ability to get this data from supported sources.
