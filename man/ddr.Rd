\description{
The DTCC Data Repository is a registered U.S. swap data repository that
allows market participants to fulfil their public disclosure obligations
under U.S. legislation. This function will give you the ability to download
trade-level data that is reported by market participants. Column specs are
inferred from all records in the file (i.e. \code{guess_max} is set to \code{Inf}
when calling \link[readr:read_delim]{readr::read_csv}).
